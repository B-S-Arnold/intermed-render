# Inter-medium

Inter-medium is an app centered around users sharing their hobbies with other users. This applications takes inspiration from
the website Medium. Developed in collaboration with 3 other developers, we mimicked some aspects of Medium while creating our own
twist and styling designs. The main goal is to allow users to share their posts and for other users to like/comment on those posts.
